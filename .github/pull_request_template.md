What problem does this change solve?

## Functional Behavior

How does code work now? Explain input -> decision -> output.

## Liability Check

Why are extra lines worth long-term maintenance cost?

## Readability Check

- [ ] No dead code
- [ ] No clever/spaghetti patterns
- [ ] Names are explicit and descriptive
- [ ] Behavior is unambiguous

## Validation

- [ ] Tests or manual validation added
- [ ] Explanation of how it was re-produced locally
- [ ] Repro steps and evidence included (screenshots or sanitized requests/response payloads for both before and after)
