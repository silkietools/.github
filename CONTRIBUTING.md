# Contributing

Goal: readable, maintainable, explainable code.

## Scope

`silkietools/.github` stores org defaults used across repositories.

## Rules

1. Submit code you can explain end-to-end.
2. For new features, prove added lines are worth maintenance liability.
3. Remove dead code; do not ship commented-out logic or unused helpers.
4. Avoid clever or spaghetti patterns; optimize for fast reasoning.
5. Use explicit, descriptive names for files, folders, functions, variables.
6. Keep behavior unambiguous; avoid unclear abbreviations.
7. Keep pull requests focused on one logical change.

## Pull Request Must Include

- Functional change summary
- Why code exists
- Why extra lines are worth liability
- Validation or test evidence

## AI usage
- emojis == ban (emoticons are fine)
- make me read too much == ban
- writing complete sentences == ban
- docstrings that explain a code signature when anyone can read the fucking method == ban
